# From Pixels to Insights: Image Dataset Generation for AI/ML in Software-Defined Networking

This repository is dedicated to the generation and analysis of image datasets for intrusion detection in Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environments using machine learning techniques. The project aims to improve upon the existing SDN DDoS attack datasets by generating enhanced datasets in image format, facilitating efficient training of machine learning models for intrusion detection systems (IDS).

## Introduction
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in safeguarding networks from malicious activities. This project leverages big data analytics and AI/ML techniques to create and optimize datasets for IDS in SDN environments. By converting network traffic features into image formats, we generate datasets that are well-suited for use in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and other deep learning models, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of intrusion detection.

This work builds upon previous research that introduced the SDN DDoS attack dataset, which was converted into images for better performance in machine learning models. The project utilizes innovative techniques like bilinear interpolation and vertical-horizontal repetition to generate 22x22 pixel grayscale images, which help improve model performance.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is derived from the original SDN DDoS attack dataset developed by Nisha Ahuja, Gaurav Singal, and Debajyoti Mukhopadhyay. The original dataset consists of 104,345 instances of network traffic with 23 features, focusing primarily on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in SDN and cloud computing environments. The dataset was initially created using the Mininet emulator and provided in CSV format.

In this project, the dataset is processed, encoded, and transformed into images to create two distinct datasets:
- **Vertical-Horizontal Repetition Dataset**: Images generated by repeating network features vertically and horizontally to form 22x22 pixel grayscale images.
- **Bilinear Interpolation Dataset**: Images generated using bilinear interpolation to enhance quality and add more depth to the features.

## Methods
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The raw dataset undergoes preprocessing, where unnecessary features (e.g., 'src' and 'dst') are dropped, and categorical features are encoded using one-hot encoding.
2. **Image Formation**:
   - **Vertical-Horizontal Repetition**: The processed features are reshaped and repeated to create an image representation of the dataset.
   - **Bilinear Interpolation**: The features are resized using bilinear interpolation to generate smooth, high-resolution grayscale images.
3. **Model Training**: The generated images are used to train machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and CNN, to assess improvements in accuracy and robustness of intrusion detection.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/From_Pixels_to_Insights.git
   cd From_Pixels_to_Insights
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the Jupyter Notebooks**: Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and open the desired `.ipynb` file to interactively generate and analyze the dataset.
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook notebooks/vertical_horizontal_method.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run the Python Scripts**: You can also use the Python scripts to generate images directly. Set the path to your dataset and execute:
   ```sh
   python src/generate_images_vertical_horizontal.py
   ```

3. **Environment Variable**: Optionally, set the dataset path using an environment variable:
   ```sh
   export DATA_FILE_PATH='path/to/your/dataset.csv'
   ```

## Results
The generated image datasets have shown significant improvements in the accuracy of intrusion detection models. The following are key observations:
- The bilinear interpolation dataset produced higher classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall compared to the original dataset.
- The vertical-horizontal repetition approach also yielded enhanced model performance, particularly in training CNN-based IDS models.
